# 3rd Semester

# 4th Semester
## AAV - Animation in Virtual Environments - Cowboy Game:
A cowboy-themed game developed in Unity for the Animation in Virtual Environments course, with the goal of learning the fundamentals
of game development, including player movement, physics interactions, AI behavior, lighting, particle effects, audio, and animation. The
project explores core concepts like scripting, UI design, and environmental effects.

## IASA - Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems - Autonomous Agent Simulation:
Project developed for the Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems course, focusing on the design and implementation of intelligent agents 
capable of autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. The project explored various AI paradigms, including reactive and deliberative agents, 
state-space search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*), and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Implemented in Python and Java, the simulation demonstrated adaptive
behaviors such as target collection, obstacle avoidance, and optimal pathfinding using heuristic-based planning.

## ICD -  Distributed Computational Infrastructures - Four in a Row LAN:
A full-stack Four in a Row game developed for the Distributed Computational Infrastructures course, built with Java, JavaServer Pages,
JavaScript, and XML. The application supports both console and web-based gameplay, featuring player authentication, profile
customization, real-time matchmaking, and a leaderboard.

## RCP - Computer Networks - Enterprise Network Deployment:
Project developed for the Computer Networks course, focused on deploying and configuring critical network services (DHCP, DNS, and Web) in a simulated
enterprise environment. The network topology included multiple LANs (A, B, and Servers), interconnected via routers with transit links. Key achievements
included automated IP address allocation via DHCP, DNS resolution, and web server accessibility. Implemented using MikroTik routers and
Cisco commands, with validation through ping and Telnet tests.

# 5th Semester
## AA - Machine Learning - Beer Review Analyser:
Developed for the Machine Learning course, this project aimed to analyze beer reviews from the RateBeer dataset to predict sentiment (positive/negative)
and multi-class ratings (smell, taste, overall), using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify reviews,
optimizing for accuracy and interpretability.

## IPM - Human Computer Interaction - ISEL Website Usability Testing:
Conducted a comprehensive usability evaluation of a redesigned ISEL university website prototype (developed in Figma) to address pain points in the existing system.
Focused on improving efficiency, learnability, and user satisfaction for 2nd/3rd-year engineering students.

## PIV - Image Processing - Sureveillance Motion Tracker:
Developed a Python/OpenCV-based algorithm to detect, classify, and track moving objects (people/cars) in surveillance footage. 
The system identifies active regions, classifies them in real-time, and generates trajectories with unique IDs, outputting an annotated video.

## SBD - Database Systems - Health Club Management System:
A full-stack application that provides role-specific functionalities for managers, personal trainers, and clients. Final project for the
Database Systems course, built with Java, JavaServer Pages, JavaScript, and MySQL. The system enables managers to oversee club
operations, personal trainers to manage schedules, and clients to enroll in training sessions, among other features.

# 6th Semester
## DAM - Mobile Applications - Video Game Collection Tracker:
Project developed for the Mobile Applications course, allows users to log, rate, and review video games while tracking their gaming history.
Built with Kotlin, Firebase, and the IGDB API.

## IAV - Interaction in Virtual Environments - Endless Runner Game:
Project developed for the Interaction in Virtual Environments course, this Unity game allows players to select an ML-Agents trained car
model that navigates a procedurally generated road, with sound as the primary control mechanism. The agents were trained by each
student in the course using deep reinforcement learning in Python.

## PRJ - Project - Cardiac Rehabilitation Support System:
A full-stack web application designed to provide real-time access to essential health data for both patients and healthcare professionals,
improving the monitoring and management of cardiac rehabilitation. Developed in collaboration with CardioID, the platform enables
personalized rehabilitation plans, patient progress tracking, and remote medical supervision. Final project of the degree built with React,
Falcon and MySQL.

## SMI - Multimedia Systems for the Internet - Velespedia:
Developed for the Internet Multimedia Systems course, this project involved implementing a MediaWiki-based CMS to create a platform similar to Wikipedia, 
but focused on satirical and esoteric content. The system allows users to create, edit, and manage articles, with features like user authentication, 
role-based permissions, and multimedia integration.
